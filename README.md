# INTRODUCTION:
The classification and detection of cerebral diseases at early stages are vital tasks
for patients in receiving proper treatment and being protected from significant
mental decline
EEG, which is short for Electroencephalogram, plays a dominant role in diagnosis
and management of patients with epileptic disorders because it is a convenient
and relatively inexpensive method to demonstrate the physiological
manifestations of abnormal cortical excitability that underlie epilepsy. It measures
the electrical activity in the brain using small metallic discs attached to the scalp.
The EEG signal is normally a function of time and represents voltage fluctuations
resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain.
Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder in which brain activity becomes
abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behaviour.
EEG contributes to the determination of seizure type and epilepsy syndrome in
patients with epilepsy, as well as choice of medication.

# THEORETICAL BACKGROUND:

I. Electroencephalography (EEG):
EEG is a medical monitoring technique that records scalp electrical activity
generated by brain structures. The electroencephalogram is defined as
electrical activity recorded from the scalp surface after being picked up by
metal electrodes and conductive media. The waveforms of the brain patterns
are usually sinusoidal and the patterns are measured from peak to peak with
amplitude that ranges from 0.5 to 100 μV.

II. Epilepsy:
Epilepsy, also known as seizure disorders, is one of the fourth most common
cerebral diseases [68] and afflicts approximately 1% of the world population.
There are more than 40 different types of seizures. A person with epilepsy
might go through one or few types of seizures
One typical feature of seizure EEG signal is that it usually involves spikes and
sharp waves, which are transient high voltage waveforms and can sometimes
be considered as an indication of seizure

III. Role of EEG in Epilepsy Detection and Treatment:
The classification and detection of cerebral diseases at early stages are vital
tasks for patients in receiving proper treatment and being protected from
significant mental decline. EEG plays a dominant role in diagnosis and
management of patients with epileptic disorders.
Specifically, as a neurophysiological biomarker, EEG contributes to the
determination of seizure type and epilepsy syndrome in patients with epilepsy,
as well as choice of medication. Although the final diagnosis of epilepsy is
usually based on thorough and professional medical examination, EEG is still
considered as a useful tool because of the supportive evidence of epilepsy it
provides.

IV. Methods used for Epileptic EEG Analysis:

1 Fast Fourier Transform:
is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a
sequence and enables signal analysis such as power spectrum. If it is a

continuous waveform that needs to be analysed, it is necessary that the
data be sampled at equally spaced intervals of time in order to present
the data as a time series of discrete samples (Nyquist Rate).

2 Wavelet Transform:
is a signal processing approach that decomposes a function or a signal
into a set of functions which consist of contractions, expansions and
translations of a mother function ψ(t), called the wavelet.
The wavelet transform can be regarded as an extension of the Fourier
transform. There are two main categories of wavelet transform,
continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and discrete wavelet transform
(DWT). The main difference between the two types of wavelet transform
is that CWT uses infinite wavelets corresponding to infinite numbers of
scales and locations, but DWT uses a finite number of wavelets.

# EEG SENSOR:
EEG sensors are placed on a participant’s head. Then the electrodes non-invasively
detect brainwaves from the subject. These sensors can record up to several
thousands of snapshots of the electrical activity generated in the brain within a single
second.

The main steps followed are:
1. Uploading EEG data set
2. Finding positions of the sensors
3. Filtering Raw EEG signal using FIR Filters
4. Slicing continuous data into several small-time segments (epochs) for
discrete data analysis

# Signal Filtering:
Signal filtering is essential and is considered as the fundamental step for EEG analysis.
It is crucial to perform signal filtering in order to smooth out random high frequency
noises. Noises with high frequencies are considered as additive to the signal and are
uncorrelated in time. Shown below are the graphs of Raw EEG signal (LHS) and
Filtered EEG signal (RHS).
A bandpass filter is set up with frequency range from 0.1Hz-40Hz, which is made up
of a Low Pass Filter (cut off 0.1Hz) and High Pass Filter(40Hz) in cascade.

A finite impulse response filter or FIR Filter is a filter whose impulse
response is of finite period. The impulse response of an Nth order
discrete time FIR filter takes precisely N+1 samples before it then settles
to zero.
FIR Filter Analysis:
Designing a one-pass, zero-phase, non-causal bandpass filter:

o Hamming window with passband ripple: 0.0194 and stopband
attenuation: 53db.
o Lower passband edge: 0.10
o Lower Transition Bandwidth: 0.10
o Upper passband edge: 40.0Hz
o Upper Transition Bandwidth: 10.0Hz
o Filter Length: 19821 samples (33.001sec)

A Patient Specific Direction or PSD is an instruction to administer a medicine to a list
of individually named patients on a list.

# FREQUENCY ANALYSIS:
We start by exploring the frequency content of our epochs by analysing auditory
brain signals.
The auditory cortex is the part of the human brain that processes auditory
information like sounds, voices or music. It receives inputs from the subcortical
auditory pathways in the brainstem and thalamus.
A growing number of studies indicate that multiple ranges of brain oscillations in the
auditory cortex, especially the delta (δ, <4Hz), theta (θ, 4-8Hz), beta (β, 13-30Hz), and
gamma (γ, 30-50Hz) bands, are engaged in speech and language processing.

# TIME-DOMAIN ANALYSIS:
At any point of time, the power with respect to that point can be found.

# TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS:

o When we perform time-frequency analysis, we are performing a moving
window Fast Fourier Transform. The FFT returns Fourier coefficients for each
combination of time and frequency - complex numbers with real and imaginary
components that describe a position in a two-dimensional plane. These
complex numbers represent both the magnitude and the phase of the signal.
o Inter-trial coherence (ITC) is a measure that is computed from single trial EEG,
which reflects the temporal and spectral synchronization within EEG. It is a
measure of how consistent oscillatory phase is across an ensemble of trials.

# CONCLUSIONS:
1. Obtained Power Spectrum of EEG Signals using different types of analysis.
2. Filtered Raw Signal using FIR-BPF filter.
3. Used Fast Fourier Transform for obtaining Power Distribution
4. Converted continuous data to discrete for analysis by converting data into epochs
